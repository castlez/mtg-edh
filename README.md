# mtg-edh
Gonna be a pretty open ended Commander playing client.

##### Install and Play (it doesn't do much right now though)
Pull the repo and run:
```
\mtg-edh:> pip install -r requirements
\mtg-edh:> cd src
\mtg-edh\src:> python game.py
```

The above will currently download a deck and set up a game of two of the same player with that deck (told ya).
